## Welcome to My GitHub

Here, you will find all of the various projects that I am currently working on.

### Finished Projects

- Within this medium post, I created a guide on how to migrate a chrome based web-scraper to an Azure virtual machine. I step the reader through the steps necessary to both setup the environment and automate the scraper to run periodically.

- Within this project my goal was to to track a Spikeball from an overhead drone view in an attempt to begin tracking sports analytics for the sport of roudnet. This project sparked more ideas to continue development in this area. [Link](https://austinulfers.github.io/spikeball-tracking/) - March 2020
