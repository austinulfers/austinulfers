This was our group's capstone project for the University of Washington's Informatics program. For this project we worked with Arrived Homes (arrivedhomes.com) in order to build an internal tool to aide the acquisitions team in finding properties for them to invest in.

The project consisted of a Python web-scraper to get active real estate listings, various Python calculators, a TSQL database to store relevant property information, a Python Django middleware API and a JavaScript React employee facing front-end.

At this internship with Reominfy, I was tasked with two major projects. The first was being able to get a forest density index based on satellite imagery for any lat/long in the world. The second was using cellular phone tracking data to make groupings of gps pings to find popularity indexes for shopping malls in Singapore.

My main project while working at American Classic Homes was building a series of web scraping applications to track the active supply of real estate properties within the greater Seattle area. By tracking our competitors that were buying land, I created an algorithm to estimate the projected completion date based on public permitting data. This analysis allowed me to find upcoming and growing market areas as well as establish data backed trends for the current market outlook.

For this project, I built a webscraper to scrape my University's poorly visualized course evaluation catalog. As a freshman, I wanted an easier way to find classes to take so after aggregating the data into one source, I created a tableau workbook to filter down the data to my criteria in order to find highly-rated classes.
