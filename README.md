# About Me

My name is Austin Ulfers and I am a current senior at the University of Washington studying Informatics with a specialized track in data science. I am currently working for PACCAR Inc as a Data Engineer Intern.

## Welcome to My GitHub

Here, you will find the various projects that I am currently working on. My latest finalized project was my successful attempt to track a Spikeball from an overhead drone view in an attempt to begin tracking sports analytics for the sport of roudnet. A [link to that project can be found here.](https://austinulfers.github.io/spikeball-tracking/)

### Future Projects

- Expand on my Spikeball sports analytics by using a convolutional neural network to identify and track the location of the ball using a camera on a tripod. I want to use the AWS Deeplens, AWS Rekognition, and AWS Sagemaker to achieve this.

- Retrieve data from my University's poorly designed course evaluation catalog and aggregate the data into Tableau to try and find classes that I might not have otherwise considered.

### Projects I am Currently Working On

- A pipeline to scrape craigslist jobs and match them to fiverr contractors, while taking a margin of the profits. [Link](https://github.com/austinulfers/job-automation)
