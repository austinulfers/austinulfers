# About Me

My name is Austin Ulfers and I am a 2021 graduate from the University of Washington. I graduated with a degree in Informatics with a specialized in data science. I am currently working for Moss Adams as a Senior Software Engineer building equity management systems for the magnificent seven. I also founded a profitable company called [Roundnet AI](https://roundnet.ai) that uses computer vision to track player stats in the sport of roundnet.

|I will outline my near production ready infrastrucutre for tracking stats of players & teams in the sport of roundnet. This include combining the use of several computer vision models to track players, the ball, and the net. I will also include some of the challenges I faced and how I overcame them. Afterwards, I will discuss the current state of the application and what I plan to do next. [Learn More](https://roundnet.ai) - **November 2022**|

Given my previous experience with computer vision in the sport of Roundnet, I decided to use what I’ve learned to create a proof-of-concept tool that can determine where a ball hits the net and translate that to a top-down view of the net.

|Description|

|This project outlines the process for tracking a roundnet ball within a video using Facebook’s Detectron2 Faster R-CNN model with transfer learning. Once objects within the video are classified, a series of algorithms and machine learning operations are performed to determine the active ball within a video of a single roundnet round. Through these operations, generalizable tracking was successfully established but further work is needed to implement analytics tracking on a per-player basis.

|This was our group's capstone project for the University of Washington's Informatics program. For this project we worked with Arrived Homes (arrivedhomes.com) in order to build an internal tool to aide the acquisitions team in finding properties for them to invest in. The project consisted of a Python web-scraper to get active real estate listings, various Python calculators, a TSQL database to store relevant property information, a Python Django middleware API and a JavaScript React employee facing front-end.

|My main project while working at American Classic Homes was building a series of web scraping applications to track the active supply of real estate properties within the greater Seattle area. By tracking our competitors that were buying land, I created an algorithm to estimate the projected completion date based on public permitting data. This analysis allowed me to find upcoming and growing market areas as well as establish data backed trends for the current market outlook.
