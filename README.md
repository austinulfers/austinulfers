Within this medium post, I created a guide on how to migrate a chrome based web-scraper to an Azure virtual machine. I step the reader through the steps necessary to both setup the environment and automate the scraper to run periodically.

Within this project my goal was to to track a Spikeball from an overhead drone view in an attempt to begin tracking sports analytics for the sport of roudnet.

### Scraping my University's Course Evaluation Catalog

<img src = "img/UW Course Eval Project.png" alt="Before & After of Scraping" width="700"/>

For this project, I built a webscraper to scrape my University's poorly visualized course evaluation catalog. As a freshman, I wanted an easier way to find classes to take so after aggregating the data into one source, I created a tableau workbook to filter down the data to my criteria in order to find highly-rated classes.
