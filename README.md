# About Me

My name is Austin Ulfers and I am a current senior at the University of Washington studying Informatics with a specialized track in data science. I am currently working for PACCAR Inc as a Data Engineer Intern.

## Welcome to My GitHub

Here, you will find all of the various projects that I am currently working on. 

### Finished Projects

- Within this medium post, I created a guide on how to migrate a chrome based web-scraper to an Azure virtual machine. Within this tutorial, I step the reader through the steps necessary to both setup the environment and automate the scraper to run periodically.

- Within this project my goal was to to track a Spikeball from an overhead drone view in an attempt to begin tracking sports analytics for the sport of roudnet. This project sparked more ideas to continue development in this area. [Link](https://austinulfers.github.io/spikeball-tracking/) - March 2020

### Current Projects

- A pipeline to scrape craigslist jobs and match them to fiverr contractors, while taking a margin of the profits. [Link](https://github.com/austinulfers/job-automation)

### Future Projects

- Expand on my Spikeball sports analytics by using a convolutional neural network to identify and track the location of the ball using a camera on a tripod. I want to use the AWS Deeplens, AWS Rekognition, and AWS Sagemaker to achieve this.

- Retrieve data from my University's poorly designed course evaluation catalog, deposit the data into a database, and aggregate the data into Tableau to try and find classes that I might not have otherwise considered.
